# Instructions for creating new repository (Delete this section)
This is a template repository; use this to create a new repository. Create a single folder for your project, with the Altium project inside.

As a checklist, please do the following when initalising:
- Ensure that the title used appropriately describes the module. Try not to use upper case, and prefix the project with ts_23_*
- Ensure that the README.md matches the project description.
- Either use the blank project inside the repository or copy and paste in your files. The .gitignore should remove all "bloated" files, but ensure that there are not unnessary copies of the project. For variants, use Git branches instead.
- Please clone the dependent ts_standard_library to access components, and make sure that it is available on your computer. Do not put it in the same folder.
- DO NOT USE COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE STANDARD LIBRARY!

# Tips
When creating versions, use branches instead of copying and pasting multiple folders/files.

Keep the folder struture clean!

When distriuting for review, use GitHub "tags" to create a small form *.zip file that is simple to download. Make sure to generate a .pdf of the project before distributing.
